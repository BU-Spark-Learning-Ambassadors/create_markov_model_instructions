# Markov Model Challenge

## Micro-Challenge: Markov Text Generation
**Difficulty: ⭐️⭐️**

### What You Will Build
In this micro-challenge, you will create a Python program that generates text using Markov models. Markov models are statistical models that predict the likelihood of a word based on the previous sequence of words. You will implement both unidirectional and bidirectional Markov models for text generation.

### How You Will Build It
You will implement a Python script with functions for creating unidirectional and bidirectional Markov models from a given text. The script will also include functions to generate text using these models.

### Duration
2-3 Hours

## Instructions

### Setup
1. **Open a Text Editor:** Choose a text editor for writing your Python code. Popular options include Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), or code-specific editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

2. **Write the Python Code:** Create a new Python file, for example, markov_text_generator.py, and copy-paste the provided code into the file. Save it with a .py extension.

3. **Run the Python Code:** Open the command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved, and execute the script by typing `python markov_text_generator.py` (or the name of your Python file) and press Enter.

### Challenge
Create a Markov text generator with the following features:

- Implement a function `create_markov_model` that takes input text and generates a unidirectional Markov model.

- Implement a function `generate_markov_text` that uses the unidirectional Markov model to generate random text.

- Implement a function `create_bi_directional_markov_model` that creates a bidirectional Markov model.

- Implement a function `generate_sentence` that uses the bidirectional Markov model to generate sentences.

### Game Rules
- Use provided template code as a starting point.

- Ensure the code is clean, well-documented, and user-friendly.

- Use appropriate data types for input and calculations.

- Implement error handling for invalid inputs.

### Challenge Extension
- Experiment with different input texts and n-gram sizes.

- Modify the text generation logic for more creative outputs.

- Explore additional features or improvements for the Markov models.

Have fun coding the Markov Text Generator and exploring the world of text generation in Python!
